# Web Scraping

various web scraping project with BeautifulSoup primarily to scrape an Austrian real estate and marketplace webpage called "willhaben"

## Description

The idea originated in my personal need to find current real estate prices and renting fees without scrolling for hours daily through the web.. 
Unfortunately with the output that rents and prices are ever only rising.. 
Nevertheless this tool should help you find current pricing and tracking of them over time.
